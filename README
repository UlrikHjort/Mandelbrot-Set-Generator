-- Mandelbrot Set Generator ---

This program generate the Mandelbrot set given by Z = Z^2 + C and save the image to a TGA file.

Usage: See code exmaples and datafiles. 

Data file format:
----------------

The data file contains a Cmin - Cmax "window" definition and some different parameters explained below. All
 data is written on a single line following the format below:

C_Real_Min    C_Img_Min  C_Real_Max  C_Img_Max  Iterations  ShiftFactor  ColorDetail  ColorMask   ColorTable
-0.7474       -0.7466    0.10694     0.10806    2000        11           100          16#660055#  1

Limits:

C_Real_Min      : C lower limit
C_Img_Min       : C lower limit
C_Real_Max      : C upper limit
C_Img_Max       : C upper limit

Parameters:

Iterations      : Number of iterations
ShiftFactor     : Set the "Base color" when color map is not used. 1 => Blue, 8 => Green, 16 => Red. 
                  Values between these gives a mix
ColorDetail     : Detail in color tones when no color map is used. Higher value => more tones
ColorMask       : A fixed base color value given as a 24 bit RGB hexnumber as:  16#RRGGBB#  
ColorTable(0/1) : Select 8 bit (256 color) color table. Selected by a 1. Not Selected by a 0.
                 If selected ShiftFactor, ColorDetail and ColorMask values are ignored.


NOTE: The Targa Library Ada is needed e.g the files Tga_lib.adb and Tga_Lib.ads need to be in the same directory as
the sources for Mandelbrot Set.
